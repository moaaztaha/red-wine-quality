# Starting in applied ML
#### A biginner project
- [x] Import Libraries and Modules
- [x] Load red wine data
- [x] Split data into training and test sets
- [x] Declare data preprocessing steps
- [x] Declare hyperparameters to tune
- [x] Tune model using cross-validation pipeline
- [x] Refit on the entre training set
- [x] Evaluate model pipeline on test data
- [x] Save model for further use

# What to do next
- [ ] Re-read and understand every bit of the code
- [ ] Try other regression model families (e.g. regularized regression, boosted trees, etc)
- [ ] Collect more data if possible 
- [ ] Engineer smarter features after spending more time on exploratory analysis
